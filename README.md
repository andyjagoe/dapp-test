[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/andyjagoe/hardhat-dapp.svg?token=Uy6FPYeyZ1PSDrsp6VVq&branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/andyjagoe/hardhat-dapp) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/andyjagoe/hardhat-dapp/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/andyjagoe/hardhat-dapp?branch=main)

# Hardhat Typescript Boilerplate

This repository contains a sample project that you can use as the starting point
for your Ethereum project. It's a modified typescript version of the [Hardhat Hackathon 
javascript boilerplate](https://hardhat.org/tutorial) that uses an OpenZeppelin ERC-20 
token instead of a proprietary token.

## Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andyjagoe/hardhat-dapp.git
cd hardhat-dapp
npm install
```

Once installed, run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, in a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, run the frontend with:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

> Note: There's [an issue in `ganache-core`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-core/issues/650) that can make the `npm install` step fail. 
>
> If you see `npm ERR! code ENOLOCAL`, try running `npm ci` instead of `npm install`.

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`. You need to change your Chain ID for localhost:8545 to 31337.

## Troubleshooting

- `Invalid nonce` errors: if you are seeing this error on the `npx hardhat node`
  console, try resetting your Metamask account. This will reset the account's
  transaction history and also the nonce. Open Metamask, click on your account
  followed by `Settings > Advanced > Reset Account`.
